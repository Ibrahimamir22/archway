# Archway Rules

These rules apply to my grad project, "Archway" (aka Interior Design Portfolio Platform with Admin, 3D/360 Visualization, Chatbot, and Enhanced Features), built with Next.js (frontend), Django (backend), PostgreSQL (database), and Docker for testing/deployment. Follow these conventions to ensure maintainability, scalability, and consistency across all phases of development.

## General Guidelines
- Write modular, reusable code with clear separation of concerns (e.g., UI vs. API logic).
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `ProjectCard` for a component, `filter_projects` for a service).
- Include concise comments to explain non-obvious logic (e.g., `// Fetch projects with pagination`).
- Adhere to Next.js and Django best practices for structure, performance, and security.
- Avoid complex or deeply nested structuresâ€”favor simplicity and clarity.
- Optimize for performance (e.g., lazy-load 3D assets) and security (e.g., sanitize inputs).
- Split code into separate files with meaningful names; keep files under 300 lines when possible.

## Frontend (Next.js) Conventions
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling and animations. Apply Tailwind classes directly in components (e.g., `<div className="p-4 bg-brand-blue text-white animate-fade-in">`).
- **Structure:** Utilize the `src/` directory and follow the Next.js App Router structure:
  - `src/app/` (e.g., `layout.tsx` for root layout, `page.tsx` for Home, route groups like `(portfolio)/portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx`)
  - `src/components/` (e.g., `common/Navbar.tsx`, `portfolio/ProjectCard.tsx`, `chatbot/ChatbotWidget.tsx`, `3d/ModelViewer.tsx`, `user/FavoritesList.tsx`)
  - `src/lib/` (e.g., `api.ts` for API calls, `threejs.ts` for 3D setup, `hooks/useProjects.ts` for custom hooks, `actions/` for Server Actions)
  - `src/styles/` (e.g., `animations.css`, global styles imported in `src/app/layout.tsx`)
  - `/public/` (e.g., `images/` for static assets, `3d/` for placeholder 3D files)
- **Tailwind Config:** Use the custom theme in `tailwind.config.js` (e.g., `brand-blue: #1E3A8A`, `animate-fade-in` for animations).
- **Modularity:** Create reusable components (e.g., `Navbar`, `Button`) in `src/components/common/` and feature-specific components in subfolders (e.g., `portfolio/`).
- **Performance:** Use Next.js `Image` for optimized images and `dynamic` imports for heavy libraries (e.g., Three.js, Pannellum).
- **Security:** Include CSRF tokens in forms (if applicable with Server Actions) and sanitize inputs before API calls.

## Backend (Django) Conventions
- **Structure:** Follow this folder structure:
  - `/interior_platform/` (e.g., `settings/` for split settings, `urls.py`)
  - `/apps/` (e.g., `projects/`, `users/`, `chatbot/`, `bookings/`, `jobs/`, `blog/`, `analytics/`)
  - `/utils/` (e.g., `security.py` for signed URLs, `email.py` for email logic, `helpers.py` for misc utilities)
  - Each app has `models.py`, `serializers.py`, `services.py` (for business logic), `views.py`, `admin.py`.
- **Settings:** Use split settings (`interior_platform/settings/base.py`, `development.py`, `production.py`).
- **Service Layer:** Keep business logic primarily in `services.py` files within each app.
- **Security:**
  - Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True` in production settings.
  - Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., emails) with `django-encrypted-fields`.
  - Use DRF serializers for input validation.
- **Database:** Use PostgreSQL and define models with clear fields (e.g., `Project` with `title`, `category`, `tags`).
- **APIs:** Use Django REST Framework (DRF) with JWT auth (`djangorestframework-simplejwt`) for secure endpoints.

## Docker Conventions
- Use Docker for local testing and production deployment with separate services: frontend (Next.js on port 3000), backend (Django on 8000), db (PostgreSQL on 5432).
- Utilize multi-stage builds in `Dockerfile`s for optimized images.
- Use separate `docker-compose.yml` for development and `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production.
- Store secrets in `.env` files (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`) and reference them in compose files.
- Ensure hot reloading works for development (e.g., volume mounts for code changes).

## Documentation
- Add comments in code for non-obvious logic (e.g., `// Configure Tailwind with custom theme`).
- Update `README.md` with setup steps, Docker instructions, and how to extend the project.
- Create placeholder files like `wireframes.md`, `erd.md`, and `api-spec.md` for planning.

## Phase 1 Focus
- Set up the project skeleton with the above structure (`src/` directory for frontend).
- Initialize Next.js with Tailwind CSS and create 1-2 placeholder pages (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/(portfolio)/portfolio/page.tsx`) styled with Tailwind.
- Initialize Django with the `projects` app, a basic `Project` model, and secure split settings.
- Configure Docker for local testing (`docker-compose.yml`) and production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) using multi-stage builds.
- Add placeholder files for wireframes, ERD, and API specs.

Follow these rules for all prompts to ensure consistency.
