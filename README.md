## Development Guidelines

1. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run migrations:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Create a superuser:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Translation System

The project supports both English and Arabic with a complete translation system:

### Frontend
- Uses next-i18next for internationalization
- Translation files in JSON format at `public/locales/{lang}/common.json`
- Components use the `useTranslation` hook with `t('key.subkey')` pattern
- Cairo font for Arabic text with automatic RTL layout
- Language switcher in the navbar

### Backend
- Django's built-in translation framework
- Models store content in both languages (e.g., `title_en`, `title_ar`)
- APIs return translated content based on the user's language preference
- Language detection via request headers or explicit `lang` parameter

## Media File Handling

The project stores and serves media files as follows:

- Project images are stored in `media/projects/` and `media/projects/covers/`
- Served via Django during development and a CDN in production
- Accessed via the models with appropriate ImageField setup
- Frontend accesses images via API endpoints
