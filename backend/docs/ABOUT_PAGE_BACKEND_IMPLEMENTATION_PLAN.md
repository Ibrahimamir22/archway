## Integration with Frontend

The backend will provide API endpoints that match the data structure expected by the frontend:

1. The `useAboutData` hook expects a combined endpoint for general about content
2. The `useTeamMembers` hook expects a dedicated endpoint for team data
3. The `useCoreValues` hook expects a dedicated endpoint for core values
4. Additional hooks will be accommodated with their respective endpoints

## Internationalization Approach

- All text content will have both English and Arabic versions
- The API will support a `?lang=en|ar` query parameter to retrieve localized content
- Alternatively, all fields can be returned together with locale suffixes

## Data Migration Strategy

1. Create models with proper fields and relationships
2. Implement data fixtures for development and testing
3. Create migrations for production with fallback data
4. Provide admin UI for content managers to update content

## Performance Considerations

1. Implement caching for API responses with appropriate cache invalidation
2. Use select_related and prefetch_related for efficient database queries
3. Implement image optimization for team member photos
4. Use pagination for endpoints that might return large datasets

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Model tests | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Validate model behavior and constraints |
| API tests | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Test API endpoints with various parameters |
| Admin tests | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Verify admin functionality |
| Integration tests | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Test with frontend components |
| Performance tests | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Measure and optimize response times |

## Security Considerations

1. Implement proper permissions for admin interface
2. Ensure read-only API endpoints for public data
3. Validate and sanitize all input data
4. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## Overall Progress

**Current Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2-3 Mostly Complete  
**Estimated Completion**: 80%

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create the about app structure
2. âœ… Define the models for AboutPage and TeamMember
3. âœ… Set up the admin interface for content management
4. âœ… Implement initial API endpoints for about content and team members
5. âœ… Create and apply migrations using Docker
6. âœ… Load initial data from fixtures
7. ðŸŸ¡ Add more advanced filtering and search capabilities
8. ðŸŸ¡ Complete comprehensive testing
9. ðŸŸ¡ Optimize performance for production
10. ðŸŸ¡ Finalize integration with frontend components

This implementation plan will be updated regularly to track progress and adjust priorities as needed.
