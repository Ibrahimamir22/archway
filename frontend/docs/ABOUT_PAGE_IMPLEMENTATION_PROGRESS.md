## Hybrid Data Fetching Approach

The About page now implements a hybrid data fetching approach that offers several benefits:

### How It Works

1. **Environment Variable Control**
   - Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=true/false` to toggle between mock API and real backend
   - Makes development/testing simpler without requiring a backend

2. **Fallback Chain**
   - In development: Mock API â†’ Backend API â†’ Fallback Data
   - In production: Backend API â†’ Mock API â†’ Fallback Data
   - Ensures resilience and graceful degradation

3. **Transparent Fallbacks**
   - Shows a notification when fallback data is being displayed
   - Provides retry functionality for user-initiated recovery
   - Maintains UI consistency even when using fallback data

4. **Combined with Server Components**
   - Server components handle metadata and initial rendering
   - Client components manage interactivity and data fetching
   - Hybrid hooks provide flexible data access
   - Combines the best of both approaches

This hybrid approach provides a robust foundation for backend integration while maintaining optimal user experience throughout the development process.

## Mock API Endpoints

The project now includes comprehensive mock API endpoints for all data types:

1. **Core Data Endpoints**
   - `/api/mock/marketing/about` - Combined about page data
   - `/api/mock/marketing/team-members` - Team member data with filtering
   - `/api/mock/marketing/testimonials` - Testimonials with category filtering
   - `/api/mock/marketing/core-values` - Core values with proper icons
   - `/api/mock/marketing/company-stats` - Statistics with formatting details

2. **API Features**
   - Locale support (en/ar) for all endpoints
   - Filtering by category, department, or featured status
   - Limit parameter for pagination or preview
   - Common response format with success/error fields
   - Metadata with counts, categories, and descriptions
   - Random failure simulation for testing fallback mechanisms

3. **Data Quality**
   - Professional, realistic content in both languages
   - Proper icon assignments
   - Structured hierarchical data
   - Consistent ordering properties
   - Rich metadata for UI enhancements

These mock endpoints allow the frontend to function properly with realistic data while backend development continues.

## Docker Integration

The project has been configured to run properly in Docker containers:

1. **Environment-specific Configuration**
   - Different URLs for container-to-container communication
   - Browser-specific URLs for local development
   - Toggle for mock API usage

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Required Node modules included in container
   - Missing dependencies (like critters) added
   - Consistent build environment

3. **Development Experience**
   - Hot reloading works within containers
   - Error reporting preserved
   - Debugging tools available

## Component Organization Best Practices

When working with this codebase, follow these organization principles:

1. **Single Component Responsibility**
   - Each component should have one clear responsibility
   - Larger components should be composed of smaller, focused ones

2. **Clear Directory Structure**
   - Group related components in domain folders (e.g., `/Stats/`)
   - Use consistent naming patterns (`StatCard`, `StatsSection`)
   - Keep directory structure flat when possible, nesting only when needed

3. **Consistent Export Patterns**
   - Use default exports for main components
   - Use named exports for utility or helper functions
   - Create index files for directories with multiple components

4. **Proper Import Paths**
   - Use absolute imports for project-wide dependencies
   - Use relative imports for closely related components

5. **Avoid Duplication**
   - Don't create multiple versions of the same component
   - Use composition over copy-pasting
   - Regularly audit the codebase for duplicates

Following these practices ensures the codebase remains maintainable and prevents errors like the duplicate components situation we encountered.

## Real-World Testing Results

The implementation has been tested in real-world scenarios with these results:

- **Performance**: Excellent loading times, even with prefetching enabled
- **Resilience**: Fallback mechanisms work as expected when API fails
- **Localization**: RTL rendering works correctly in Arabic locale
- **Accessibility**: Good initial results, with improvements planned
- **Cross-browser**: Works well in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Mobile**: Responsive design renders correctly on various screen sizes
