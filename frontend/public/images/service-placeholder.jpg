// This is a placeholder for a binary image file.
// In a real implementation, you would need to create a real JPG image file.
// Since we can't create binary content here, this text serves as a placeholder instruction.
// 
// A real implementation would involve:
// 1. Creating a JPG file with dimensions around 800x600
// 2. Adding placeholder text like "Service Image" overlaid on a neutral background
// 3. Saving it as public/images/service-placeholder.jpg
//
// For now, the frontend can be configured to download a placeholder from a CDN
// or provide a default component that renders text when images are not available.
